This repository is the main MineRL BASALT 2021 Competition **submission template and starter kit**!

MineRL BASALT is a competition on solving human-judged tasks. The tasks in this competition do not have a pre-defined reward function: the goal is to produce trajectories that are judged by real humans to be effective at solving a given task.

See [the homepage](https://minerl.io/basalt/) of the competition for further details.

**This repository contains**:
*  **Documentation** on how to submit your agent to the leaderboard
*  **The procedure** for Round 1 and Round 2
*  **Starter code** for you to base your submission (an agent that takes random actions)!

**Other Resources**:
- [AICrowd competition page](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2021-minerl-basalt-competition) - Main registration page & leaderboard.

# How to Submit a Model on AICrowd.

In brief: you define your Python environment using Anaconda environment files, and AICrowd system will build a Docker image and run your code using the docker scripts inside the `utility` directory.

You submit pretrained models, the evaluation code and the training code. Training code should produce the same models you upload as part of your submission.

Your evaluation code (`test_submission_code.py`) only needs to control the agent and accomplish the environment's task. The evaluation server will handle recording of videos.

You specify the task you want to submit agent for with the `aicrowd.json` file, `tags` field (see below). **One submission only covers one task**!

## Setup

1.  **Clone the github repository** or press the "Use this Template" button on GitHub!

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/minerllabs/basalt_competition_submission_template.git
    ```

2. **Install** competition specific dependencies! **Make sure you have the [JDK 8 installed first](http://minerl.io/docs/tutorials/getting_started.html)!**
    ```
    # 1. Make sure to install the JDK first
    # -> Go to http://minerl.io/docs/tutorials/getting_started.html

    # 2. Install the `minerl` package and its dependencies.
    ```

3. **Specify** your specific submission dependencies (PyTorch, Tensorflow, kittens, puppies, etc.)

    * **Anaconda Environment**. To make a submission you need to specify the environment using Anaconda environment files. It is also recommended you recreate the environment on your local machine. Make sure at least version `4.5.11` is required to correctly populate `environment.yml` (By following instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)). Then:
       * **Create your new conda environment**

            ```sh
            cd basalt_competition_submission_template
            conda env create -f environment.yml 
            conda activate minerl
            ```

      * **Your code specific dependencies**
        Add your own dependencies to the `environment.yml` file. **Remember to add any additional channels**. PyTorch requires the channel `pytorch`, for example.
        You can also install them locally using
        ```sh
        conda install <your-package>
        ```

    * **Pip Packages** If you need pip packages (not on conda), you can add them to the `environment.yml` file (see the currently populated version):

    * **Apt Packages** If your training procedure or agent depends on specific Debian (Ubuntu, etc.) packages, add them to `apt.txt`.

These files are used to construct both the **local and AICrowd docker containers** in which your agent will train. 

If above are too restrictive for defining your environment, see [this Discourse topic for more information](https://discourse.aicrowd.com/t/how-to-specify-runtime-environment-for-your-submission/2274).

## What should my code structure be like ?

Please follow the example structure shared in the starter kit for the code structure.
The different files and directories have following meaning:

```
.
├── aicrowd.json             # Submission meta information like your username
├── apt.txt                  # Packages to be installed inside docker image
├── data                     # The downloaded data, the path to directory is also available as `MINERL_DATA_ROOT` env variable
├── test_submission_code.py  # IMPORTANT: Your testing/inference phase code. NOTE: This is NOT the the entry point for testing phase!
├── train                    # Your trained model MUST be saved inside this directory
├── train_submission_code.py # IMPORTANT: Your training code. Running this should produce the same agent as you upload as part of the agent.
├── test_framework.py        # The entry point for the testing phase, which sets up the environment. Your code DOES NOT go here.
└── utility                  # The utility scripts which provide a smoother experience to you.
    ├── debug_build.sh
    ├── docker_run.sh
    ├── environ.sh
    ├── evaluation_locally.sh
    ├── parser.py
    ├── train_locally.sh
    └── verify_or_download_data.sh
```

Finally, **you must specify an AIcrowd submission JSON in `aicrowd.json` to be scored!** 

The `aicrowd.json` of each submission should contain the following content:

```json
{
  "challenge_id": "neurips-2021-minerl-basalt-competition",
  "authors": ["your-aicrowd-username"],
  "description": "sample description about your awesome agent",
  "tags": "FindCave",
  "license": "MIT",
  "gpu": true
}
```

This JSON is used to map your submission to the said challenge, so please remember to use the correct `challenge_id` as specified above.

You **need to** specify the task of the submission with the `tags` field with one of the following: `{"FindCave", "MakeWaterfall", "CreateVillageAnimalPen", "BuildVillageHouse"}`. You need to create one submission per task to cover all tasks.

Please specify if your code will use a GPU or not for the evaluation of your model. If you specify `true` for the GPU, a **NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU** will be provided and used for the evaluation.

### Dataset location

You **don't** need to upload the MineRL dataset in submission and it will be provided in online submissions at `MINERL_DATA_ROOT` path, should you need it. For local training and evaluations, you can download it once in your system via `python ./utility/verify_or_download_data.py` or place manually into the `./data/` folder.

## How to submit!

To make a submission, you will have to create a private repository on [https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/).

You will have to add your SSH Keys to your GitLab account by following the instructions [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys.html).
If you do not have SSH Keys, you will first need to [generate one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair).

Then you can create a submission by making a _tag push_ to your repository on [https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/).
**Any tag push (where the tag name begins with "submission-") to your private repository is considered as a submission**  
Then you can add the correct git remote, and finally submit by doing :

```
cd competition_submission_starter_template
# Add AIcrowd git remote endpoint
git remote add aicrowd git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:<YOUR_AICROWD_USER_NAME>/basalt_competition_submission_template.git
git push aicrowd master

# Create a tag for your submission and push
git tag -am "submission-v0.1" submission-v0.1
git push aicrowd master
git push aicrowd submission-v0.1

# Note : If the contents of your repository (latest commit hash) does not change,
# then pushing a new tag will **not** trigger a new evaluation.
```

You now should be able to see the details of your submission at: `https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/<YOUR_AICROWD_USER_NAME>/basalt_competition_submission_template/issues/`

**Best of Luck** :tada: :tada:

# Ensuring that your code works.

You can perform local training and evaluation using utility scripts shared in this directory. To mimic the online training phase you can run `./utility/train_locally.sh` from the repository root, you can specify `--verbose` for complete logs.

For local evaluation of your code, you can use `./utility/evaluation_locally.sh`, add `--verbose` if you want to view complete logs. **Note** that you do not need to record videos in your code! AICrowd server will handle this. Your code only needs to play the games.

For running/testing your submission in a docker environment (identical to the online submission), you can use `./utility/docker_train_locally.sh` and `./utility/docker_evaluation_locally.sh`. You can also run docker image with bash entrypoint for debugging on the go with the help of `./utility/docker_run.sh`. These scripts respect following parameters:

* `--no-build`: To skip docker image build and use the last build image
* `--nvidia`: To use `nvidia-docker` instead of `docker` which include your nvidia related drivers inside docker image
